      Table/Binary.pm: 
       * optionally don't split vectors out of input data (VecSplit).
         affects read_rows_array
	         read_col_col_array
		 read_row_row_array
		 read_col_row_array

       * allow caller to provide own hash or array for
	       read_row_row_array
	       read_row_row_hash
	       read_col_row_array

       * when possible, use cached internal buffers for i/o to prevent
         memory thrashing.

       * optimized access/converting of row/col data.  mostly
         untested, as don't have any column oriented tables.
