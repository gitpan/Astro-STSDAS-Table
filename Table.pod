Astro::STSDAS::Table - access STSDAS format table files

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Astro::STSDAS::Table> is a collection of routines to read STSDAS
table files (see L<http://stsdas.stsci.edu/STSDAS.html> for more
information on the format).  Casual users should peruse 
B<Astro::STSDAS::Table::Simple>.  

Those requiring a more flexible interface may wish to use
B<Astro::STSDAS::Table::Binary>, which is a subclass of
B<Astro::STSDAS::Table::Base>.
