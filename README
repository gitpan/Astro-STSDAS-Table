NAME
    Astro::STSDAS::Table - access STSDAS format table files

DESCRIPTION
    Astro::STSDAS::Table is a collection of routines to read STSDAS table
    files (see <http://stsdas.stsci.edu/STSDAS.html> for more information on
    the format). Casual users should peruse Astro::STSDAS::Table::Simple.

    Those requiring a more flexible interface may which to use
    Astro::STSDAS::Table::Binary, which is a subclass of
    Astro::STSDAS::Table::Base.

    The package currently suffers from the following flaws:

    *       Only binary tables are supported

    *       Tables can only be read.

    *       Reading of column-ordered binary tables is untested.

    *       Reading of binary tables with vector elements is untested.

    *       The test table was written on a big-endian machine, and the
            tests will therefore fail on little-endian systems.
